# Cruise-database-Management 
### A c++ program for Database Management using File Handling Concepts
## Abstract
The main idea of developing this cruise database system CPP project is to provide simple Software for cruise management system
Its aim is to collect various vital data like passport number, traveller’s name, traveling details, computing bill.
The optima cruise management software is the complete, leading, most advanced system for the cruise ship industry, cruise management, document management system. Synchronized online and telephonic boat reservation system would increase your reservation.
## Tools and Technique’s
  •	We are developing this project using Turbo C++  using Data file handling to manage the data.
  •	File Handling concept in C++ language is used for storing the data permanently in computer. Using file handling we can store our data in Secondary memory (Hard disk).
## Advantages
  •	Efficiency and performance are maintained. 
  •	Concurrency, Backup, Recovery, Integrity and data description is the basic purpose for using the database.
  •	Better access to data and also effective data integration.
  •	Data Consistent.
  •	Fast service and no time delay.
## Conclusion
The primary objective of this project is that we were able to solve the problems which was related to database, the system is operated at high level  of efficiency for :
  •	keeping the record of customer.
  •	help in reduce time and money.
  •	Easy updates were available.
Finally, Cruise database management fully meets subjectives and objectives of the system which has been developed. The system has reached a steady state where all the bugs have been eliminated.
